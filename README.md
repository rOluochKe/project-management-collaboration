# Project Management & Collaboration API

The project API is a backend service that powers the web application for task and project management. It provides a set of endpoints that allow clients to interact with the application's data and perform various operations. The API enables users to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks, projects, teams, and users. It also supports relationships between these entities, such as assigning tasks to projects and teams, and associating users with teams and tasks.

The API follows RESTful principles and uses HTTP methods to perform different actions on the resources. It supports JSON as the data exchange format. The API provides endpoints for retrieving lists of tasks, projects, teams, and users, as well as endpoints for retrieving individual entities by their unique identifiers. It also includes endpoints for creating new entities, updating existing ones, and deleting entities from the system.

The project API serves as the backend for the task and project management application, providing the necessary functionality to manage and organize tasks and projects efficiently. It allows clients to integrate with the application, build custom interfaces, or automate certain tasks by leveraging the exposed endpoints.
